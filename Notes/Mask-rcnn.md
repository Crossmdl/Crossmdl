# [Mask-Rcnn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)

This is the landmark paper in cv for object detection and localization. The task - video-text alignment has strong parallels with Mask-RCNN. Here we have to propose
time-stamps that belong to same textual-piece(temporal segmentation) much like what we do spatially if we want to segment a image into objects. Thus I thought it would be better to understand this paper.
